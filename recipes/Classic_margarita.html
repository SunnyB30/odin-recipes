    <h2>This recipe is one developed by my family and I. We enjoy drinking margaritas on a hot summers day. It pairs perfectly well with spicy cuisine such as 
        mexican and even indian dishes. The acidity from the lime balances the mild heat from the chilli salt rim. We recommended a good quality tequila for this recipe.
